<h2>Favorite Songs</h2>


<p>My friends thought I was strange for my taste in music all through elementary school, junior high, and then highschool</p>
        <p>
          I discovered the band named 'The Cars' at a very young age. My parents
          were big rock fans. I do like a few songs from their first album in
          1978, self titled 'The Cars'.
